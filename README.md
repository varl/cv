# Curriculum Vitae

## Introduction
Dedicated web developer with an eye out for The Next Big Thing™ capable and
eager to work on projects small and large where the vision is greater than
the sum of its parts. An independent worker with a fluid mind ensures
out-of-the-box thinking and a unique approach to problems and solutions.

## But who am I?
Well, My [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/varlfu) is completely public, so is my [Github profile](https://github.com/varl), and sometimes I [tweet stuff](https://twitter.com/varlx). I like weightlifting, programming, meditation, and motorcycles. I'm not a big fan of skiing, though it taught me valuable life lessons about priorities through injury. I like to write, which I do privately at [my blog](http://www.vlv.io) and I have been known to rant about topics that disturb me at [Iterate's blog](https://blog.iterate.no/author/vikvar/).

I run a company registered in Sweden called [vardevs](http://www.vardevs.se). I don't do much with it except host sites, buy domains, administer servers and the occasional development and operations for friends and family. It's an ongoing learning experiment about how a company works and has taught me about taxes, VAT, inter-country invoices, book keeping and publishing yearly reports.

All-in-all _curious_ is a word I would not mind being applied to my personality. Currently I explore **Clojure**, **Go**, and **Elm**.

## What'll happen next?
It is of increasing import to have meaning in my work, and to support this goal, first
the word 'meaning' needs to be unpacked. This far I have these principles to guide me towards meaningful work:

- Create value
- Reduce waste

## Skills
![Buzz...buzz..buzz](res/buzz.jpg)

I focus on the bigger picture and strive to be full-stack. **NodeJS**, **Python**, **Java**, **\*sh** running on **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS** are the primary system level environments I rely on to do my job. **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** to create great user experiences in the client and back it using database storage such as **IndexedDB**, **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL** which I write hand-tuned **SQL** for. I deploy using **VPS** technology and set it up to hardened linux configuration and **nginx** for serving content and proxying requests to applications.

For heavy hitters I set up cloud deployment to e.g. **Amazon's Cloud** or **Google's Cloud** and use **metrics** to automatically scale load-balance the production environments. **Measurements** drive a **pro-active** development mentality.

I **test** my code using automated routines which run against every **commit** to our preferred **VCS**, the marvellous **Git**. I am **autonomous** within the **team**'s **alignment**. I take **responsibility** for our work as a whole and help out where I can.
