# Curriculum Vitae

## Introduction
Dedicated web developer with an eye out for The Next Big Thing™ capable and

## What'll happen next?
It is of increasing import to have meaning in my work, and to support this goal, first
the word 'meaning' needs to be unpacked. That job is not finished, although thus far I have these
moral rules to guide me towards meaningful work:

- Create value
- Reduce waste

To me, no matter the context, these rules can guide my actions forward and ensure they stand up to ethical scrutiny.
