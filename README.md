# Curriculum Vitae

## Introduction
Dedicated web developer with an eye out for The Next Big Thing™ capable and
eager to work on projects small and large where the vision is greater than
the sum of its parts. An independent worker with a fluid mind ensures
out-of-the-box thinking and a unique approach to problems and solutions.

## But who am I?
Well, My [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/varlfu) is completely public, so is my [Github profile](https://github.com/varl), and sometimes I [tweet stuff](https://twitter.com/varlx). I like weightlifting, programming, meditation, and motorcycles. I'm not a big fan of skiing, though it taught me valuable life lessons about priorities through injury. I like to write, which I do privately at [my blog](http://www.vlv.io) and I have been known to rant about topics that disturb me at [Iterate's blog](https://blog.iterate.no/author/vikvar/).

I run a company registered in Sweden called [vardevs](http://www.vardevs.se). I don't do much with it except host sites, buy domains, administer servers and the occasional development and operations for friends and family. It's an ongoing learning experiment about how a company works and has taught me about taxes, VAT, inter-country invoices, book keeping and publishing yearly reports.

All-in-all _curious_ is a word I would not mind being applied to my personality. Currently I am exploring: Clojure, Go, and Elm.

## What'll happen next?
It is of increasing import to have meaning in my work, and to support this goal, first
the word 'meaning' needs to be unpacked. This far I have these principles to guide me towards meaningful work:

- Create value
- Reduce waste
